# Activity - Functions

## Objective

Apply functions in Assembly Language.

## Prerequisites

- Before doing the lab, please review the [Functions lecture](https://github.com/d-khan/assembly/blob/main/functions/Lecture.md).
- This lab will only work if you run the code on a Linux platform using an Intel x86 platform. The online assembler will not work due to the lack of debugging features.
- Knowledge of how to run assembly code using nasm assembler in Linux OS.
- Knowledge of how to debug an assembly code using `gdb`.

## Task

Perform the following tasks:

1. Assign a number to a register or a variable, pass a number to the function and display the result, 'odd' or 'even'. The result should be displayed on the console. The function should check whether the number is an even or an odd number.

## What to submit?

1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io/) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice. (1 mark)
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? (1 mark)
3. Working and error-free code. (8 marks)

## How to submit it?

- Upload the work in Canvas and clearly define your responses.
- Upload the code in __.txt__ format and include comments to describe the code.
- __Do not compress or zip your work.__

## Deadline

The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric

- All the questions are answered, and the working code is submitted. (Grade 100%)
- Questions are partially answered, and the code has errors or incorrect output. (Grade 50%)
