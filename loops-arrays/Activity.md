# Activity - Loops and arrays instructions

## Objective

Learn to perform loops and arrays instructions in Assembly Language.

## Prerequisites

- Before doing the lab, please review the lecture.
- This lab will only work if you run the code on a Linux platform using an Intel x86 platform. The online assembler will not work due to the lack of debugging features.
- Knowledge of how to run assembly code using nasm assembler in Linux OS.
- Knowledge of how to debug an assembly code using `gdb`.

## Task

Perform the following tasks:

1. Generate a counter using an EBX register, debug, and explain your findings. Use the code written in the  [counter (optimized version) example](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/d-khan/assembly/blob/main/loops-arrays/Lecture.html).  **2 points**
2. Calculate the final number of the first 10 Fibonacci numbers starting from 0. The result should be equal to 55. **2 points**
3. Define the array with length 3 and, type integer, find the largest element in the array. Use `gdb` to debug the code and verify that the code is working well and as per the requirement. **6 points**

## What to submit?

1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io/) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice.
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)?
3. Working and error-free code.

## How to submit it?

- Upload the work in Github and clearly define your responses.
- Share the Github link.

## Deadline

The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric

- All the questions are answered, and the working code is submitted. (Grade 100%)
- Questions are partially answered, and the code has errors or incorrect output. (Grade 50%)
