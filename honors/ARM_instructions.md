# Lab: Assembly language for ARM processors

## Objectives
Writing code in assembly language on ARM processors

## Tasks
Perform the following tasks:  
1. Research and find out how different assembly language is for ARM processors compared to Intel processors.
2. The following assembly code is written for an Intel 32-bit processor. Convert the code for the ARM processor, and execute it.
3. Based on your research, will you be able to quantify the efficiency of running an assembly code on Intel & ARM processors?  

## Prerequisite
- [Lecture on arithmetic instructions](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/d-khan/assembly/blob/main/arithmetic-instructions/Lecture.html)
- [Creating repository - quick guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories)
- [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## What do you think I should submit?
1. Share the source code and write down the commands used to make the source code executable.  
2. Create and share a video that explains the process of assembling, linking, running, and debugging the source code.

$var4 = (var1+var2)*var3$

```assembly
section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov eax,[var1]
    add eax,[var2]
    mov dl,[var3]
    mul dl
    mov [var4],eax
    
    mov eax,1
    int 0x80

section .data
    var1 DD 5 ; var1 is assigned 5
    var2 DD 2 ; var2 is assigned 2
    var3 DD 3 ; var3 is assigned 3
    
segment .bss
    var4 resb 1
```


  
## How to submit it?
Upload your code and the explanation in Git Hub and share the repository on Canvas.

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Canvas.

## Rubric
- The code is shared and working; the video explains assembling, linking, running, and debugging. (10 marks)  
- The code is not shared, but the video explains the code. (4 marks)
- The code is shared but not working, regardless of the video showing the working solution. (0 marks)
