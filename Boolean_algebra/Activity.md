# Activity - Boolean algebra

## Objective

Apply Boolean algebra and simplify equations

## Prerequisites

- Before doing the lab, please review the lecture.

## Task
1. Simplify the following equation:

$ F = A'B'C + A'B'C + A'BC + AB'C + ABC' $

2. Simplifying an equation using Boolean algebra properties: Motion-sensing light.

- Inputs: m: motion sensed, t: test mode

- Outputs: i: illuminate lamp

- Goal: Illuminate lamp if motion and not test mode, or if test mode and no motion, or if test mode and motion  

Write the equation and then simplify the original equation

## What to submit?

1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io/) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice. (1 mark)
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? (1 mark)

## How to submit it?

- __Do not compress or zip your work.__

## Deadline

The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
