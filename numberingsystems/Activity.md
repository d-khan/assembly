# Activity - Encyption/decryption using XOR

## Objective

Learn how to encrpyt/decrypt using a XOR logical operator.

## Prerequisites

- Before doing the lab, please review the lecture.

## Task
**Please note:** No need to write a code. Use paper and pencil and solve the following tasks.

Perform the following tasks:
### Encrypting the message
1. Select a secret "one English word" message. Keep it secret.
2. Convert the message into binary form. Each alphabet has a corresponding ASCII representation. Find out the [equivalent ASCII representation](https://www.asciitable.com/) of each character in the message.
3. Create a secret “one English word” key. For simplicity, use the same length of word key as the message. Then, repeat step two to convert the “secret key” into the binary form.
4. Apply XOR bitwise operation between the message and the key. The output will be the encrypted message in binary form. 
5. Convert the encrypted binary message into hexadecimal form for easy sharing.
### Decrypting the message
1. Use the "encrypted message" and the "secret key" and perform the bitwise XOR operation.
> **Remember to convert the encrypted message and the key into the binary form before applying the bitwise XOR operation**
2. Verify that the decrypted message is the same as the "plain text".

## What to submit?

1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io/) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice. (1 mark)
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? (1 mark)
3. Encryption (4 marks)
4. Decryption (4 marks)

## How to submit it?

- Upload the work in Canvas and clearly define your responses.
- Upload the code in __.txt__ format and include comments to describe the code (if the code is used).
- __Do not compress or zip your work.__

## Deadline

The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric

- All the questions are answered, and the working code is submitted. (Grade 100%)
- Questions are partially answered, and the code has errors or incorrect output. (Grade 50%)
