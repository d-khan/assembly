# Syllabus (CISC-211 Computer Organization & Assembly Language) Honors Contract
__This syllabus is for Honors Contract Students only__

## Course description
This course is an introduction to the organization of modern digital computers and assembly language programming. Topics include language syntax, instruction set mnemonics, and segment, index, pointer, general purpose, and flag registers. A variety of memory addressing techniques are covered, as well as stack operations, particularly those associated with passing parameters to subroutine calls. Additional topics include machine architecture, memory addressing, input/output, interrupts, control structures, compiling, linking, and printer and disk interfaces. This course is intended for students majoring in computer and information sciences.

The students enrolled in the Honors Contract are expected to do independent research, extra assignments, and 1:1 meetings with the professor. The student will be involved in Work-Based Learning activities in which students get in touch with career services, improve resume writing and interviewing skills, and get in touch with professionals in the relevant field.

## Student learning outcomes
- Demonstrate an ability to successfully follow a specification. Measurement Method: Development of classroom projects.  
- Demonstrate an ability to successfully create electronic documents. Measurement Method: Performance on homework assignments.

## Accommodating Students with Disabilities

Ensuring the accessibility of this course to students with disabilities is important to me. I have made every effort to make this course accessible; however, if you encounter a problem accessing anything in the course, please contact me immediately. Students who have academic accommodation letters should send them to me as soon as possible so that I am able to provide the accommodation in a timely manner. Students with disabilities who are requesting accommodation for the first time should email me and should contact the Disability Support Programs and Services (DSPS) office to initiate the accommodation request process.

> DSPS is located in the K1 Student Services building, room K1-204 and can be reached at (619) 388-7312 or by email at miradsps@sdccd.edu. To register or to learn more about their services, please visit the DSPS website at www.sdmiramar.edu/dsps.

## Undocumented & Immigrant Student Services

Undocumented and immigrant students are welcome in this class. As an educator, I strive to be an ally and provide a safe learning environment for you regardless of your immigration status. Your legal status should not be an obstacle to you in my classroom or to your educational success.
The Miramar Dreamers Support Office provides programs and services to undocumented and immigrant students. The Dreamers staff can meet with you for one-on-one support sessions, connect you to financial aid and scholarship resources, provide information about how to earn money, and host weekly engagement activities. Every student who needs one gets a FREE immigration-related legal consultation with our partners at the Higher Education Legal Services, too!

> Visit the Dreamers Support Office in the Student Services Building, room K1-304 (third floor), or online at <https://sdmiramar.edu/services/dreamers>. Schedule an appointment at <https://bit.ly/dreamerappt>.

## Cheating/Plagiarism
Students are expected to be honest and ethical at all times in the pursuit of academic goals. Students who are found to be in violation of Administrative Procedure 3100.3 Honest Academic Conduct, will receive a grade of zero on the assignment, quiz, or exam in question and may be referred for disciplinary action in accordance with Administrative Procedure 5520, Student Disciplinary Procedures.

## Honest Academic Conduct

Students are expected to adhere to the Honest Academic Conduct policy at all times. Students who violate the Honest Academic Conduct policy may be removed from class by the faculty for the class meeting in which the behavior occurred and the next class meeting.
- For online classes: Student access to class is removed for one week (5 instructional days).

No make-up work will be accepted during the removal.

> The Honest Academic Conduct policy can be found in Board of Trustees Policy, BP 5500, Student Rights, Responsibilities, Campus Safety and Administrative Due Process posted on the District website at:

## Sustainability

Miramar College is committed to sustainability in our classrooms and on campus. To minimize paper use, please consider whether a document can be shared digitally rather than printed. When a document must be printed, decrease margins to 0.8” and print on both sides of the paper.  
 
You are encouraged to bring reusable drink containers to school (and fill them at the water dispensers located around campus). For single-use packaging, please use the recycle bins for plastics, paper, cans, and cardboard.  
 
Thank you for doing your part to conserve resources in your academic life and keeping our campus environment clean.
