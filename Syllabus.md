You are expected to be honest and ethical at all times in the pursuit of academic goals. Students who are found to be in violation of Administrative Procedure 3100.3, Honest Academic Conduct, will receive a grade of zero on the assignment in question and may be referred for disciplinary action in accordance with Administrative Procedure 3100.2, Student Disciplinary Procedures.  

Plagiarism — to take and pass off as one’s own work or ideas of another — is a form of academic dishonesty.
Plagiarism is any one of the following: 
- Verbatim copying without proper acknowledgment on term papers, homework or tests/exams;
- Paraphrasing without proper acknowledgment;
- Putting together a “patchwork” paper from diverse sources, without proper acknowledgment of those sources;
- Unacknowledged appropriation of information or of someone else’s ideas.

Acts of plagiarism will result in no credit awarded for the assignment; remedial instruction; academic or
administrative sanctions; and/or other consequences. 

> The Honest Academic Conduct policy can be found in Board of Trustees Policy, BP 5500, Student Rights, Responsibilities, Campus Safety and Administrative Due Process posted on the District website at:
