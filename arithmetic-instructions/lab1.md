# Arithmetic instructions

## Objective
Use arithmetic instructions to solve the equation.

## Pre-requisite
Review the "Arithmetic Instructions" lecture before attending the lab. 

## Task
Solve the following equations.
a. var4 = (var1 + var2) * var3
b. 


## What to submit?
1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice. **(2 marks).**   
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? **(2 marks)**.  
3. Create a video that explains the working of the code. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). Also, submit the code in the .txt extension. **(6 marks)**

## How to submit it?
- Upload your work in the .pdf or .txt format and clearly define your responses.  
- Use headings when possible. Upload the code in the .java extension.
- Do not compress or zip files.

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)
