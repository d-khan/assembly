## __Attendance/Absences__

## __Accommodating Students with Disabilities__

- Students with disabilities who may need academic accommodations are encouraged to discuss their authorized
accommodations from Disability Support Programs and Services (DSPS) with their professors early in the semester so
that accommodations may be implemented as soon as possible.
- The faculty member will work with the DSPS Office to ensure that proper accommodations are made for each student.
By law, it is up to the DSPS Office, through the interactive process with the student, to determine which
accommodations are appropriate, not the instructor. This includes accommodations in a clinical setting.
- Students that need evacuation assistance during campus emergencies should also meet with the instructor as soon as
possible to ensure the health and safety of all students.

> For more information, you may contact the DSPS Office on your campus or the website at
<https://www.sdccd.edu/about/departments-and-offices/student-services-department/dsps/index.aspx> or refer to
Administrative Procedure, AP 3105.1 Academic Accommodations and Disability Discrimination for Students with
Disabilities.

## __Cheating/Plagiarism__

Students are expected to be honest and ethical at all times in the pursuit of academic goals. Students who are found to be in
violation of Administrative Procedure 3100.3 Honest Academic Conduct, will receive a grade of zero on the assignment, quiz, or exam in question and may be referred for disciplinary action in accordance with Administrative Procedure 3100.2, Student Disciplinary Procedures.

## __Honest Academic Conduct__

- Students are expected to adhere to the Honest Academic Conduct policy at all times. Students who violate the Honest
Academic Conduct policy may be removed from class by the faculty for the class meeting in which the behavior occurred, and the next class meeting.
- __For online classes:__ Student access to class is removed for one week (5 instructional days).
- Acceptance of make-up work during the removal will be decided by the instructor based on the incident.
- Incidents involving removal of a student from class will be reported to the college disciplinary officer for follow up.

> The Honest Academic Conduct policy can be found in Board of Trustees Policy, BP 5500, Student Rights, Responsibilities,
Campus Safety and Administrative Due Process posted on the District website at:
