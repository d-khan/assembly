# Activity - Procedures

## Objective
Learn to write procedures in Assembly Language.

## Prerequisites
- Before doing the lab, please review the lecture.
- This lab will only work if you run the code on a Linux platform using an Intel x86 platform. The online assembler will not work due to the lack of debugging features.
- Knowledge of how to run assembly code using nasm assembler in Linux OS.
- Knowledge of how to debug an assembly code using `gdb`.

## Task

Perform the following tasks:
1. Generate English uppercase characters from A to Z. After every character, there must be a line feed. Use procedures and loops to optimize the code. No need to use gdb. The executable file will run directly on the terminal.

## What to submit?

1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io/) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice.
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)?
3. Working and error-free code.

## How to submit it?
- Upload the work in Canvas and clearly define your responses.
- Upload the code in __.txt__ format and include comments to describe the code.
- __Do not compress or zip your work.__

## Deadline

The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric

- All the questions are answered, and the working code is submitted. (Grade 100%)
- Questions are partially answered, and the code has errors or incorrect output. (Grade 50%)
